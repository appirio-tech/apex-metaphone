Description
===========
A client needs to do some matching on a field based on phonetic pattern matching. Currently they utilize the SoundEx algorithm which is dated. Metaphone will provide a more accurate phonetic pattern matching algorithm to improve matching for bad spellers.

Requirements
============
Implement only Metaphone not Metaphone 3 or Double Metaphone. English is the only language that must be supported. The diphthong matching database will be created as a custom object with data. Your method should return a list of possible matches based on the inputed string.
